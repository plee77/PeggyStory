One day, Bob came to a party and told the doorman that he is a friend of Simon. Simon replied, “I AM Simon.” Bob was terribly embarrassed. Simon was nice enough to let him in, since their common friend had told Simon about Bob beforehand.
When Bob got in, he met with all of his friends and had a grand time. His friends and him partook in the festive party activities. These included board games and loads of candy eating contests. By the time Bob was all tired out, it was around midnight. So he had to make the walk back. 
Along his walk back, bob decided to stop at the convenience store. Bob grabbed a cold soda and bag of chips before heading out back to his house. It was a rather cold night and Bob wished that he had remembered his gloves.
As he walked on the street, he heard someone calling his name. He remembered what his mother told him when he was young: never turn around when walking on the street alone in the middle of the night. Bob decided to walk faster.
He heard his name again. This time, he chose to fulfill his curiosity over safety. It was his elementary school classmate. They talked about the stupid things they once did and made plans for the upcoming spring break.
