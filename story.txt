One day, Bob came to a party and told the doorman that he is a friend of Simon. Simon replied, “I AM Simon.” Bob was terribly embarrassed. Simon was nice enough to let him in, since their common friend had told Simon about Bob beforehand.
When Bob got in, he met with all of his friends and had a grand time. His friends and him partook in the festive party activities. These included board games and loads of candy eating contests. By the time Bob was all tired out, it was around midnight. So he had to make the walk back.
